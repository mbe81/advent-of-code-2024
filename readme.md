# Advent of Code 2024

Repository to store my solutions (in Go) for the Advent of Code puzzles for 2024.

Use the following command to run the puzzles:

    go run ./cmd/aoc -day=1 -part=1 -input=input.txt

The `part` flag and `input` flag are optional:

- If the `part` flag is omitted, both part 1 and 2 will run
- If the `input` flag is omitted, the file `input.txt` will be used.

Happy puzzling!
